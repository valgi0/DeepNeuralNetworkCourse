# DeepNeuralNetworkCourse

This repository contains all experiments, personal notes, free pdfs, and stuff related to Deep Neural Network.
This repository is going to be  update some times in the next days. I'm going to study a lot and produce a lot
of documentation about **theory** and **practice**.
  
In detail:

* Math behind neural network in deep.
* New Neural network general pourpose.
* Neural Network in different fields as NLP, Computer Visioning, etc etc.
* Pytorch framework in detail
* keras maybe
  

I hope to be able to pair concepts with experiments
Experiments will be **Google colab notebook**


## Organization
This repository has more directory where things are stored and collected.
To make everything clear I created the following directories:

* *config*. It contains all configuration file
* *free_pdf*. It contains all PDFs, Slides, documents, papers, links usefull
* *note*. It contains note written in *tex*.
* *experiments*. It contains experiments in notebook files.

Each of these directory contains sub directories to keep documents ordered.

## Random COnsideration

This is a work I'm doing for myself and myself alone. It's my goal to better understand 
Deep Neural Network and how to use them. This repository is public because knowledge must be shared
or this is what I believe. You, my dear, are free to read all and be happy! But don't judge me if this work
is incomplete. I don't like complete what I'm doing, I prefer leave the last part at the immagination.
